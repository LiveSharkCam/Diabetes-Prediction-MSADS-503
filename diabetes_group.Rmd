## Dataset Overview and Objective

The **Diabetes Prediction** Dataset is a comprehensive collection of medical and demographic records aimed at identifying the likelihood of diabetes in patients. Each observation in the dataset includes both physiological and lifestyle-related features, along with a binary outcome indicating whether the individual is diabetic (positive) or not (negative).

Key variables in the dataset include:

Age: The age of the patient
Gender: Male or Female
Body Mass Index (BMI): A measure of body fat based on height and weight
Hypertension: Indicates whether the patient has high blood pressure (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
Heart Disease: Indicates the presence of cardiovascular disease (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
Smoking History: Categorical variable showing smoking habits (e.g., never, current, former)
HbA1c Level: Average blood sugar level over the past 2–3 months, measured in percentage
Blood Glucose Level: Instantaneous measure of blood sugar at the time of recording
Diabetes Status: Target variable indicating whether the patient is diabetic (positive) or not (negative)
The primary objective of this analysis is to develop a predictive classification model that determines whether an individual is likely to have diabetes based on their medical and lifestyle attributes.

Categorical variables were converted to factors for better readability and modeling. Binary values (0 and 1) for hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes were relabeled as "No"/"Yes" or "Negative"/"Positive" to improve interpretability.

```{r}
# Convert to proper types -> 0 and 1 to "yes" and "no"
df <- df %>%
  mutate(
    gender = as.factor(gender),
    smoking_history = as.factor(smoking_history),
    hypertension = factor(hypertension, levels = c(0,1), labels = c("No", "Yes")),
    heart_disease = factor(heart_disease, levels = c(0,1), labels = c("No", "Yes")),
    diabetes = factor(diabetes, levels = c(0,1), labels = c("Negative", "Positive"))
  )

# Check "No Info" in smoking history
df %>% 
  count(smoking_history) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n))
```
Smoking history was cleaned by renaming "No Info" to "Unknown" and merging similar categories. "Ever," "former," and "not current" became "Former" (19.8%), while "Never" (35.1%) and "Current" (9.3%) were kept unchanged.

```{r}
# Consolidate smoking history categories
df <- df %>%
  mutate(smoking_history = factor(smoking_history)) %>%
  mutate(
    smoking_history = fct_collapse(smoking_history,
      "Never" = "never",
      "Former" = c("ever", "former", "not current"),
      "Current" = "current",
      "Unknown" = "No Info"
    )
  )

# Check "No Info" in smoking history
df%>% 
  count(smoking_history) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n))

We are dropping "others" because they are only  18 observations (0.018% of 100k dataset) won't impact analysis


```{r}

# Create the plot

Key Findings from Correlation Analysis

High-Risk Indicators
• HbA1c > 6.2% & glucose > 140 mg/dL
• Age > 60, hypertension, heart disease

Protective Factors
• HbA1c < 4.8% & glucose < 100 mg/dL
• BMI < 23.63, age < 24

Notable Patterns

Clear biomarker thresholds
Progressive age-risk relationship
Gender shows minor association

```{r}
# Comorbidity analysis
comorbidity_analysis <- df %>%
  group_by(hypertension, heart_disease) %>%
  summarise(
    diabetes_rate = mean(diabetes == "Positive"),
    count = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

ggplot(comorbidity_analysis, aes(hypertension, heart_disease, fill = diabetes_rate)) +
  geom_tile() +
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(diabetes_rate, accuracy = 0.1))) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "firebrick") +
  labs(title = "Diabetes Rate by Comorbidities",
       x = "Hypertension", y = "Heart Disease")
```

## Data Preprocessing 


```{r}
# Handle BMI outliers using quantile capping
summary(df$bmi)

#calculate the 0.5% and 99.5% percentiles
bmi_caps <- quantile(df$bmi, probs = c(0.005, 0.995), na.rm = TRUE)
print(bmi_caps)



```
The observed BMI values, ranging from 13.89 to 52.50, fall within the clinically plausible range of 12 to 60. This suggests that all recorded measurements are physiologically valid. As a result, we chose to retain all BMI values without applying any capping.



```{r}
# Convert necessary variables to numeric for correlation
corr_data <- df %>%
  mutate(
    hypertension_num = as.numeric(hypertension) - 1,  
    heart_disease_num = as.numeric(heart_disease) - 1,
    diabetes_num = as.numeric(diabetes) - 1
  ) %>%
  select(age, bmi, HbA1c_level, blood_glucose_level, 
         hypertension_num, heart_disease_num, diabetes_num)

# Compute correlation matrix
cor_matrix <- cor(corr_data)
cor_matrix


```

```{r}
#correlation
corrplot(cor_matrix, 
         method = "color",        
         type = "upper",         
         tl.col = "black",       
         tl.srt = 45,           
         addCoef.col = "black",  
         number.cex = 0.7,       
         diag = FALSE)          

# Print notable correlations (> 0.3)
notable <- which(abs(cor_matrix) > 0.3 & upper.tri(cor_matrix), arr.ind = TRUE)

if(nrow(notable) > 0) {
  cat("\nNotable Correlations:\n")
  for(i in 1:nrow(notable)) {
    row <- notable[i,1]
    col <- notable[i,2]
    cat(rownames(cor_matrix)[row], "&", 
        colnames(cor_matrix)[col], ":", 
        round(cor_matrix[row,col], 2), "\n")
  }
} else {
  cat("\nNo notable correlations found (all r < 0.3)\n")
}
```
The correlation matrix reveals moderate relationships between key clinical variables and diabestes, so we won't change anything 

```{r}
# Create clinically relevant features
df <- df %>%
  mutate(
    high_hba1c = factor(ifelse(HbA1c_level >= 6.5, "Yes", "No")),
    high_glucose = factor(ifelse(blood_glucose_level >= 200, "Yes", "No")),
    age_group = cut(age, breaks = c(0, 30, 45, 60, 100),
                    labels = c("<30", "30-45", "46-60", "60+")),
    bmi_category = cut(bmi, breaks = c(0, 18.5, 25, 30, 100),
                      labels = c("Underweight", "Normal", "Overweight", "Obese"))
  )

head(df)

```



```{r}
# prepare modeling data
model_data <- df %>%
  select(-age_group, -bmi_category) %>%
  mutate(diabetes = as.factor(diabetes))

# create encoding model (EXCLUDING diabetes)
dummy_model <- dummyVars(~ . , 
                         data = model_data %>% select(-diabetes),
                         fullRank = TRUE)

# apply encoding to predictors only
encoded_predictors <- predict(dummy_model, newdata = model_data) %>% 
  as.data.frame()

# add target variable back
final_data <- encoded_predictors %>% 
  mutate(diabetes = model_data$diabetes)

```


```{r}
glimpse(final_data)

```{r}
# Save processed data
